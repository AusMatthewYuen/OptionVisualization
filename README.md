Intro

Hi; this is just me trying to figure out how to use GitHub to store code and see how branches work.

The idea of the program is to determine the implied volatility per option, and compare it against its 1 year historical volatility, determine the chance of the option falling into the money, and expected value of the option. Option Valuation is something I still don't fully grasp - I've been unable to grab a proper risk neutral valuation as of yet. 

The option valuation functions are sourced from http://www.codeandfinance.com/finding-implied-vol.html
Many thanks to the author of that; I learned a lot from various websites, like Al Sweigart's automatetheboringstuff.com and the Python for Finance book by Yves Hilpisch, and the Python for Data Science course by Jose Portilla.
